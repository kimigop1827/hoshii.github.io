My name is Kim Joseph, I'm currently in senior school.
I'm a coder living in Tabaco City, I love to explore and learn good things on social networks. Here I will tell a little about my hubby playing online game was born in 2006. Currently studying and working in Tabaco National High School. Currently I work as a Social Networking Service, Making Messenger Bot, Making Tools Logo - Picture, Ddos. At the present time, I am quite successful in the field of Programming and Social Networking. To get to the position where I am now, I had to stand firmly on this difficult and challenging road, I had to explore and supplement my knowledge a lot during the years of searching and pursuing. The Covid-19 pandemic has changed me a lot and realizing my strengths and weaknesses, I will try to do my best, thank you to everyone who has always supported and helped me in the past time and i have problem bcuz my tiktok account got banned :< <!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->

My dream is to become a really good programmer who can do many projects by myself.
